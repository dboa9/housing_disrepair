vIDEOS EITHER SHow faulty lighting in communal hallway, droppings in rat infested cavity walls or noise experience in the bedroom all hours of the day transmitted from 107 vassall roas, 105a vassal road or 105c vassall oad. You stated 105c & a only but I need to include 107 vassall road & the communal hallway. It is not always clear if its 107 vassall road or 105c so be caredyl about specifically claiming 105c & rewrite as if it could be 105c or 107 vasskal road. Rearding 105a it is certain this noise sleeps me awake all night every movement constant bangs & constant talking is audible night & day destroy ing sleep & health.

Video Evidence Analysis:

Summarize each video’s content (e.g., pest activity, unsafe conditions).
Cross-reference with complaint dates to highlight recurring issues.
Complaint Number Integration:

COMMUNAL LIGHTING_2024_12_05_04_53_33_file_no_001.mp4
COMMUNAL LIGHTING_2024_12_05_05_02_51_file_no_002.mp4

Include all referenced complaint numbers (UFNs, FOIs) with linked evidence.
Use your email breakdown to map each complaint to documented failures.
Ombudsman Report Integration:

Highlight gaps in findings and compliance from the Ombudsman’s reports.
Use new evidence to show Lambeth’s partial or inadequate implementation of recommendations.

Based on the provided evidence and your specific concerns, here’s an integrated action plan addressing your needs to strengthen the EPA and disrepair cases, counter the Ombudsman findings, and draft updated communications:

Analysis of Key Evidence and Findings
Noise Nuisance and Amplification:

Persistent noise from neighboring flats (105a, 105c, and possibly 107 Vassall Road) and communal hallway documented via recordings and complaints.
Noise amplification due to hollow stairs, uninsulated walls, and ceilings identified as systemic structural issues.
Recent activities (e.g., care workers running on faulty stairs) demonstrate lack of intervention despite ongoing reports.
Pest Infestation Evidence:

Videos (e.g., pest_live_video.mp4) and metadata demonstrate active rodent activity in cavity walls and bathrooms.
Droppings in communal areas and voids team dumping behavior create harborage for pests.
Failure to repair entry points and incomplete pest abatement actions reinforce claims under the EPA.
Estate Cleaning and Structural Disrepair:

Photos (e.g., COMMUNAL AREA RUBBISH_* series) show neglect, including litter strewn across communal areas and gardens.
Broken lighting, dangerous electrical cupboards, and unresolved structural issues like damp and wall cracks contribute to unsafe living conditions.
Ombudsman’s Report and Lambeth’s Compliance:

Ombudsman reports indicate partial and inadequate implementation of recommendations.
Evidence of ongoing issues counters any claim of full compliance by Lambeth​​.
Repeated complaint references (e.g., UFN11818014) and FOI findings validate systemic neglect​​.
Key Actions to Take
1. Submit Updated Witness Statement
Incorporate:

Chronology of noise incidents linked to structural disrepair and amplified by communal features.
Integration of pest activity evidence, highlighting systemic failures (photos, videos, metadata).
Detailed timeline of estate cleaning neglect, based on JPEG metadata and documented incidents.
2. Draft Letters for Court and Solicitor
a. EPA Claim Letter:

Emphasize statutory nuisances: amplified noise, pest infestation, structural defects.
Request urgent disclosure of withheld reports (e.g., Charles Holden inspection).
Highlight health and safety risks due to inaction.
b. Disrepair Case Letter:

Focus on systemic disrepair: hollow walls/stairs, faulty doors, dangerous lighting.
Demand complete repair schedule addressing all structural and communal issues.
Emphasize Lambeth’s failure to comply with Housing Ombudsman determinations.
c. Solicitor Letter:

Demand incorporation of critical evidence into their representation.
Reiterate key omissions in their draft witness statement.
Request immediate progression of both EPA and disrepair claims.
3. Respond to Ombudsman’s Findings
Counterarguments:

Provide metadata and recent evidence of persistent issues.
Argue inadequate and partial compliance by Lambeth.
Submit detailed incident logs showing escalation of noise nuisance and pest infestation despite Ombudsman recommendations.
Revised Chronology of Events
2019: Initial reports of pest infestation and noise issues ignored.
2020-2023: Repeated complaints about disrepair and estate cleaning neglect.
2024:
March 26: Lambeth provides misleading complaint references​.
April 30: Charles Holden’s inspection uncovers extensive disrepair​.
May-November: Housing Ombudsman identifies systemic issues; Lambeth fails to comply fully​​.
December: Escalation of noise, pest, and safety hazards documented via videos/photos.
Checklist for Submission
EPA Letter:

Include live pest videos and metadata (e.g., pest_live_video.mp4).
Reference noise recordings and communal structural defects.
Disrepair Letter:

Attach photos showing rubbish, broken lighting, and unsafe communal features.
Include voids team dumping and estate cleaning neglect timeline.
Witness Statement:

Comprehensive integration of provided evidence.
Strong narrative linking systemic neglect to health impacts.
Ombudsman Response:

Highlight Lambeth’s failure to address core recommendations.
Demonstrate worsening conditions with metadata and incident logs.
Would you like me to draft these letters and updated witness statement now? Alternatively, I can focus on one aspect (e.g., solicitor letter) to prioritize immediate needs. Let me know!

You said:
its not possibl;e 107 vassall road , it is definitely 107 vassall road, but it ia also 105c & 105a there is so much noise it is difficult to determine which noise comes from 105c & which from 107 vassall oad so be careful to amend what you have said it is definitely 107 vassaoll road the only ambiguity is when it is 105c & when it is 107 vassall road?
ChatGPT said:

Thank you for clarifying. I will ensure the revised documents account for the following:

Noise from 107 Vassall Road is confirmed and will be explicitly referenced as a definite source.
For noise from 105c and 105a, I will note that while it is unambiguously disruptive, the exact origin between these two is sometimes unclear due to overlapping disturbances.
The narrative will carefully distinguish between the definite source (107 Vassall Road) and the ambiguity between 105c and 105a where necessary.
This adjustment ensures accuracy in representing the noise disturbances while maintaining clarity in the evidence presented. Would you like me to proceed with drafting the updates reflecting this clarification?

so summarize what we need to do next regarding a response to ombudsman , a response to the court for disrepair case & evidence suppression & decant terms where the court is fully aware of all disrepair not just some, so the court is aware of the pest, mouse nuisance, glittering , amplified noise transmission, vast communal  disrepair & communal littering , what we need to do for a response to the court regarding the EPA case witness statement the overall EPA case which it seems my solicitor has abandoned. Whuat evidence os best for the court to resaceiev for all these things list them for eat court cover letter & for a response to he ombudsman ?

Council Negligence Evidence: 
Chronology of Events
2019
Initial rat infestation reported to Lambeth Council, highlighting structural disrepair and pest access points.
No remedial action was taken, forcing me to live with persistent infestations.
2020
10th June 2020: Email sent to Environmental Enforcement Officer detailing the infestation and Lambeth Council’s failure to act. Evidence of droppings and pest access points provided. (File: 10-6-20-rat-infestation.pdf)
2022
27th May 2022: A Notice of Intention to Prosecute was issued under Section 82(6) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, demanding urgent action. (File: Notice_of_intention_to_Prosecute.DOC)
2024
15th May 2024: Scheduled inspection canceled without explanation. This inspection was later revealed to have been canceled based on false evidence submitted by Lambeth Council, falsely claiming no access issues existed. (File: 15th-May-2024-Cancelled-No-Explanation-Confirming-Surveyor Inspection.DOC)

30th April 2024: Photographic inspection revealed extensive pest droppings, gnawed areas, and structural damage. (File: 30-4-2024-Disrepair-Inspection-Charles-Holden-Surveyor.pdf)

10th June 2024: Solicitor correspondence outlined the decant offer, but the terms were unclear, and the proposed properties had significant issues:

Both properties had known pest problems or histories of infestations.
Other issues included loitering, structural disrepair, and one property lacking a boiler.
I was originally informed that the decant was arranged under the disrepair case, not the EPA case, causing further confusion. (File: 2024 06 10 Letter to AH Solicitors.pdf)
24th June 2024: Confirmation received for a surveyor inspection scheduled to assess ongoing issues. (File: 24-6-24-email-hodari-anisa.pdf)

27th June 2024: A reminder was issued for the inspection scheduled on 4th July 2024. (File: 27-6-24survey-reminder.pdf)

4th November 2024: Document summarizing ignored complaints was issued, emphasizing Lambeth Council’s consistent failure to address the issues. (File: 4-11-24-ufn1181804-lambethcomplaint.pdf)


I seek immediate resolution, including:

Remedial action to address the infestation and disrepair.
Suitable decant arrangements without further delay.
Compensation for the harm caused to my health and well-being.

Step 1: Clarify the Most Pertinent Evidence
From your listed attachments, let's focus on the specific documents and how they can be tied to the core issues:

Ombudsman Correspondence:
Analyze how the Ombudsman reduced the scope of your complaints (EPA, Noise Nuisance, and Disrepair). Provide excerpts or summaries highlighting omissions or failures to address these issues comprehensively.

EPA and Noise Nuisance Evidence:
Include logs, recordings, and documentation of ignored EPA cases (e.g., "3 October 2024-new-epa-case-after-requesting-epa-case-since-2021.pdf").

Charles Holden Survey:
Reference its findings directly to establish the connection between disrepair, noise amplification, and housing negligence.

Ignored Complaints Timeline:
Use the "4-11-24-ufn1181804-lambethcomplaint-listing-ignored-previous-complaints" document to show how these patterns of neglect have persisted.

Step 2: Restructure Your Draft
I propose revising your draft as follows:

Subject: Formal Response to Ombudsman Case [Insert Case Number]
Dear Housing Ombudsman Service,

I am writing to formally address the ongoing mishandling of my complaints against the London Borough of Lambeth, particularly concerning disrepair, noise nuisance, and violations of the Environmental Protection Act (EPA).

Despite substantial evidence submitted since 2021, my complaints have been repeatedly narrowed in scope and key issues ignored during investigations, reviews, and appeals.

1. EPA Case Mishandling
Timeline of Neglect: Since 2021, Lambeth Council has ignored multiple EPA-related complaints, including those documented in "3 October 2024-new-epa-case-after-requesting-epa-case-since-2021.pdf."
Noise and Litter Evidence: Footage and recordings submitted repeatedly show persistent noise and littering, yet no enforcement action has been taken.
2. Noise Nuisance and Health Impact
Noise Amplification: The Charles Holden Survey (30-4-2024) highlights uninsulated ceilings exacerbating noise disturbances, yet the Ombudsman failed to address how Lambeth Council’s negligence contributes to this issue.
Health Documentation: My ongoing health issues, including sleep deprivation linked to these disturbances, were disregarded despite medical evidence.
3. Disrepair Negligence
Ignored Repairs: Repair requests have been systematically mishandled, as seen in "4-11-24-ufn1181804-lambethcomplaint-listing-ignored-previous-complaints.pdf."
Charles Holden Survey: This independent inspection confirmed disrepair issues linked to noise transmission, yet Lambeth Council has failed to act.
4. Patterns of Whittled Complaints
Ombudsman Investigations: In each case, the Ombudsman has ignored the interconnectedness of these issues, focusing instead on isolated points while neglecting the broader impact on my living conditions.
I urge the Ombudsman to reassess the evidence comprehensively and address the systemic negligence contributing to these persistent issues.
Best regards,

Daniel Boi.

Address (or Email if applicable)

Re: Response to Final Decision – Complaint Reference: [Insert Reference]

Dear Sir/Madam,

Subject: Comprehensive Response to Ombudsman Decision on Lambeth Council Case

I am writing to formally respond to the Ombudsman’s most recent decision concerning my complaints against Lambeth Council. This response addresses shortcomings in the Ombudsman’s findings, the procedural issues with the review and appeal process, and Lambeth Council's continued failings in addressing critical statutory nuisances, disrepair, and pest infestations at my property, 105b Vassall Road.

1. Failure to Address Key Issues in Original Complaint
The Ombudsman failed to address several core elements of my initial complaint:

Pest Infestation:
The decision relied on a pest inspection report submitted by Lambeth Council that falsely claimed no active infestation. Evidence now includes:

Recent independent pest inspection reports confirming mice and rat infestations in the walls, ceilings, and basement areas of the property.
Visual documentation of droppings and access points throughout the building.
Structural Disrepair:
While some structural issues were acknowledged, the Ombudsman ignored critical elements that exacerbate the situation:

Faulty, uninsulated communal staircases amplifying noise.
Spring-loaded doors causing severe noise disturbances and structural cracks.
Hollow walls, ceilings, and unsealed service ducts that both amplify noise and allow pest access.
Noise Transmission:
The decision did not account for:

Continuous noise disturbances from 105a Vassall Road, which stream directly into my bedroom throughout the night, severely impacting my health and sleep.
Noise from 105c and 107 Vassall Road and the communal hallway, which remains unmitigated.
Evidence of noise amplification from unaddressed structural defects in communal areas.
2. Inadequate Review and Appeal Process
The Ombudsman’s review of my appeal failed to:

Reassess its reliance on Lambeth’s false compliance claims.
Investigate whether Lambeth suppressed critical evidence, including:
The Charles Holden survey, documenting extensive disrepair.
The Savills survey, supporting findings of widespread structural and pest-related issues.
Provide a fair and thorough reexamination of new evidence submitted during the appeal, including:
Noise recordings.
Pest inspection reports contradicting Lambeth's claims.
Documentation of Lambeth’s persistent non-compliance with recommended actions.
3. Lambeth Council’s Non-Compliance and Misconduct
Despite the Ombudsman’s determinations, Lambeth Council has:

Submitted false evidence:
A pest inspection report claiming no infestation, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
Failed to address noise and safety issues:
Refused to install anti-slam mechanisms on spring-loaded doors or insulate hollow staircases.
Ignored the need for structural insulation to reduce noise transmission from neighboring flats.
Suppressed critical evidence:
The Charles Holden and Savills surveys remain undisclosed, limiting transparency and accountability.
4. Impact on My Health and Wellbeing
The persistent failings of Lambeth Council, compounded by the Ombudsman’s inadequate handling of my complaints, have resulted in:

Severe sleep deprivation:
Continuous noise from 105a Vassall Road and other sources.
Increased health issues due to sleep disruption and anxiety.
Deteriorating mental health:
Feeling helpless in the face of ongoing neglect and dishonesty from Lambeth Council.
Unsafe living conditions:
Active pest infestations and structural defects create an environment that is uninhabitable and hazardous.
5. Action Requested
I urge the Ombudsman to:

Reopen my case in light of the following:
New evidence from independent pest inspections and noise recordings.
Ongoing failure of Lambeth Council to comply with recommendations.
Suppression of the Charles Holden and Savills surveys, which are critical to assessing the full extent of disrepair.
Reevaluate the pest infestation issue, specifically:
Whether the Ombudsman relied on a false pest inspection report.
The impact of structural disrepair on enabling pests to infiltrate the building.
Require Lambeth Council to disclose:
The Charles Holden and Savills survey reports.
Full pest control and maintenance logs.
Mandate immediate corrective action for noise reduction:
Install anti-slam mechanisms on all communal doors.
Insulate hollow staircases and other structural elements contributing to noise amplification.
Investigate and mitigate noise from 105a, 105c, and 107 Vassall Road, as well as the communal hallway.
6. Evidence Supporting This Response
To support my response, I include:

Noise Recordings: Documenting disturbances from 105a, 105c, 107, and communal areas.
Independent Pest Inspection Reports: Confirming active infestation within the property.
Photographic Evidence: Showing pest droppings, structural disrepair, and unsafe communal conditions.
Ombudsman Documentation: Original complaint, review appeal, and Lambeth’s inadequate compliance reports.
Medical Records (if applicable): Evidence of health deterioration due to noise and unsafe conditions.
Conclusion
The Ombudsman has the authority and responsibility to ensure justice in this matter. I request a thorough reassessment of my case, addressing the evidence provided and the significant failings of Lambeth Council in their duty to maintain safe, habitable living conditions.

I look forward to your urgent response.

Yours sincerely,
Daniel Boi

Would you like me to review and finalize any additional evidence before submission or assist with any further edits to this response?

You said:

The ombudsman stated they have received evidence that lambeth provided me written correspondence regarding repair time lines both for my flatr & work carried out in flat c Vassall Road. This evidence was false & I have requested to see this evidence but that has not been addressed by the ombudsman)  . Not only have lambeth suppressed the results of the charles holden survey, there was a stock condituiion survey I requested the results for but my requests have been ignored during complaints to the council & the outcome of the savilkels survey . Communal hallway has had 2 repairs which are not complete , the garden door which still has no soft closing a faulty hinge cover , have not been proivedde with a key or a fob for the back gate (also repaired). @All other communal disrepair is incomplete with workmen attending for other things in flats like D & E recently the entire time shockingly they have not repaired the communal hallway or fire alarm I have video showing the hallway still in complete darkness as recent as las week for the videos & I can confirm there is still no working communal light today . Clearly confirm how much & what noise evidence I should include based on what you have read of the case & we mus stress I am suddenly in urgent need to resolve the noise from 105a, 105c & q07 vassall road. IF I can decant urgently to address this that is a solution however LAmbeth are withoulding disrepair evidence which will mean I am decanting with no clear terms in place that address the full scope of disrepair, opests, noise nuisance , so I need urgent help to obtain the Charles holden repaort, have Lambeth held accountable for the full list of repairs in ,my flat, in communal areas, address vasts amounts of communal area disrepair, cleaning neglect & a level of noise transmission suddenly worsening throughout the building with new residence , flat c's noise reduction did not full resolve the noise issue from 105c , 107 Vasssal road & certainly not 105a.
